## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project was how can 4 Muslim women help other women. We wanted a safe place for those who have experienced sexual assault to find advice, heal and move forward while doing so anonymously. It is also a form of collecting data using data equity for those who have been sexually assaulted. we are trying to provide accurate information by taking away the pressure of being found out (via anonymity) which other forms of data may not have, thus increasing the accuracy of our data. Allowing those researching or in need of data can find as accurate data as possible.

## What it does
Our web app will allow you to open it and only ask you for very little information such as are you older than 18, state, and what form of assault have you experienced. From there you are provided links to direct you to the best sources. On the other end based on the buttons clicked there minimum information is saved into a data frame and used to be presented in a data chart shown on the web app.

## How we built it
- Building this web app we used streamlit 
- coding in python. 

## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we ran into was getting streamlit started up. Took us all day to figure out how to get it working on VS and unfortunately put us back by a lot.
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting some coding done. My team is are all beginner coders and so we were worried we would not be able to do anything but the little bit we got to spend on streamlit we got some code done. 

## What we learned
As a team, we learned to come more prepared. possibly knowing what tools we will be using beforehand so we do not run into these problems in the future. 
## What's next for A place for Healing "Shifa. Com" 
To expand on our project we would not only like to add the data aspect of the project but also expand to other issues. Such as Race and discrimination in your community, Islamaphobia, mental health, and abuse.
